``nltk_theme`` is a fork of `Insegel`_, which is a theme for `Sphinx`_, a Python based documentation engine. It is used on `nltk.org`_, to host the official NLTK documentation.
The theme itself can be deployed anywhere, but has specific enhancements for hosting on `ReadTheDocs`_.

It provides a mobile-friendly, monochrome 2 column layout with an emphasis on typographical legibility and consistency.
