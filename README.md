# NLTK Theme

NLTK Theme is a [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) theme forked from the wonderful [Insegel](https://github.com/autophagy/insegel/), designed for the [NLTK](https://github.com/nltk/nltk) documentation. The theme can be previewed over at www.tomaarsen.com/nltk.

This theme is not necessarily intended for reuse. I would advise looking at [Insegel](https://github.com/autophagy/insegel/) if you'd like to use a similar theme.
