# NLTK Theme

NLTK Theme is a [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) theme forked from the wonderful [Insegel](https://github.com/autophagy/insegel/), designed for the [NLTK](https://github.com/nltk/nltk) documentation. The theme can be previewed over at www.tomaarsen.com/nltk.

### Installation

This theme is not necessarily intended for reuse. I would advise looking at [Insegel](https://github.com/autophagy/insegel/) if you'd like to use a similar theme.

That said, you may install it via pip:
```
pip install nltk_theme
```
Then, you can tell Sphinx to use the theme by adding:
```
html_theme = 'nltk_theme'
```
to your project's `conf.py`.
